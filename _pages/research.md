My current research focuses on the development of data analytic strategies to identify low allelic frequency somatic mutations in a variety of next-generation sequencing study designs with particular emphasis to neuropsychiatric disorders and developmental diseases. Developing highly sensitive and specific pipelines to isolate and characterize somatic mutations requires intimate knowledge and understanding of next-generation sequencing technologies as well as the topology and nature of the human genome.

I am working to determine the contributions of somatic mutations with several bipolar disorder cohorts. We are approaching the hypothesis from several study designs including single and paired sample designs, DNA derived from brain and whole blood, and utilizing several sequencing technologies (whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, and 10X Genomics sequencing). Datasets were both generated internally as well as acquired from public resources.
