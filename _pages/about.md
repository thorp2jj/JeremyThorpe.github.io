My doctoral dissertation is focused on investigating the contributions of somatic mosaicims to developmental and psychiatric disorders. This research is conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Pevsner of Johns Hopkins University and the Kennedy Krieger Institute. Presently, my attention is centered on the contributions of somatic single nucleotide and copy number variants to the etiology of Bipolar Disorders. Prior to this work I received extensive training in epigenetics, investigating chromatin remodeling during oncogenesis and cellular differentiation, under the guidance of Dr. Mazhar Adli at the University of Virginia.
